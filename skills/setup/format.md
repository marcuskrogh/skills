# WORKSPACE.md format

Canonical workspace setup artifact for pipeline skills. Default path:
`docs/agents/WORKSPACE.md`.

If this file is missing, pipeline skills **stop** and ask the user to run `/setup`
(unless the user explicitly says to proceed with defaults — then use the
**Defaults** section below and still write the file before creating issues).

## Template

```markdown

## Notes

- …
```

## Defaults (only if user opts out of full setup)

| Field | Default |
|-------|---------|
| Provider | `markdown` |
| Issues dir | `docs/agents/issues` |
| Key prefix | `MD` |
| Mirror | `true` |
| Mirror path | `docs/agents/ISSUES.md` |
| Roadmap / Plan / Model | repo root `ROADMAP.md`, `PLAN.md`, `MODEL.md` |
| Base branch | `main` |
| Open PR | `true` |
| Merge | `squash` if repo uses squash; else `merge` |

## Continuity rule

Regardless of remote tracker, when **Mirror to markdown** is true (recommended):

1. Create/update rows in the mirror file whenever issues are created, transitioned, or handed off.
2. Always write keys + **Next** into `ROADMAP.md` / `PLAN.md` / issue bodies.
3. Remote tracker remains authoritative for status **except** for `markdown` provider, where issue files are authoritative.
