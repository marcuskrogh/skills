# Concept: Alignment

**Uninvokable concept.** Skills that need this behaviour must instruct the agent to
read this file on invoke. Do not surface this concept unless a skill references it.

## Purpose

Reach **fundamental agreement** between agent and user through relentless, adaptive
questioning — one question at a time — until divergence points are resolved.

This concept defines *how* to align. Skills define *what* is being aligned on and
*what artifact* alignment produces.

## What this is not

- Not a user-invokable workflow
- Not a questionnaire, intake form, or batched Q&A
- Not a lecture, overview, or announced question plan before the first question
- Not implementation, coding, or delivery — those belong to other concepts
  (e.g. `CONCEPT_IMPLEMENTATION`)

## Extension contract

Skills that apply this concept **must** define:

| Extension | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Subject** | What agent and user are aligning on |
| **Probes** | Domain areas to cover via targeted questions |
| **Stop condition** | When alignment is complete (default: no obvious divergence points remain) |
| **Alignment artifact** | Format and filename of the agreed summary (if persisted) |
| **Readiness prompt** | How to close alignment after presenting the artifact |

Skills **may** define:

| Extension | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Opening** | Thin vs rich context handling for the domain |
| **Final clarification** | Last question(s) before the artifact |
| **Format override** | Question presentation (e.g. `Q1:` labels, LaTeX-only blocks) |
| **Scope guard** | Topics excluded during alignment (e.g. no code) |

**Invariants** below always apply. Format overrides change presentation only — never
one-question-per-message or adaptive sequencing.

## Invariants

- **One question per message.** No lists of questions, questionnaires, planned
  batches, or previews of upcoming questions.
- **Start with the subject.** First message is a question — no preamble, scope
  lecture, or "here is what I will ask."
- **Adaptive.** After each answer, update what is agreed vs unknown; ask the next
  highest-value question.
- **Concrete and direct.** Short questions; brief acknowledgments only when needed.
  No filler or small talk.
- **Relentless on divergence.** Prioritize ambiguities, tradeoffs, and assumptions
  that would change the outcome. Do not nitpick settled points; do not re-ask clear
  answers.

## Divergence points

A **divergence point** is any choice where multiple valid paths exist and a wrong
assumption would waste rework or produce the wrong artifact.

Prefer questions that collapse divergence points. Skills list domain probes; this
rule governs selection order.

## Flow

### 1. Opening

| Context | First move |
|---------|------------|
| **Thin** — topic named, little detail | One broad opener (skill supplies wording) |
| **Rich** — user already describes the subject | Use context; skip broad opener; ask first question on an unresolved divergence point |

### 2. Alignment loop

1. Ask one short question about the current unknown.
2. Wait for the answer.
3. Revise the mental model of agreed vs unknown.
4. Repeat until the skill's **stop condition** is met.

### 3. Closing

1. Ask any **final clarification** (one question per message).
2. Present the **alignment artifact** per the skill.
3. Ask the **readiness prompt**.
4. If the user names a gap → resume the loop on that gap.
5. If the user approves → alignment ends.

## Format overrides

Skills may override *presentation* while keeping invariants:

| Override | Example |
|----------|---------|
| Question labels | `Q1:`, `Q2:`, … |
| Single-block output | Entire message is one LaTeX `$$ … $$` block |
| Extended artifact | Summary is the only long-form output in alignment |

State overrides in the skill. See `model` for a full format override example.

## Anti-patterns

- Multiple questions in one message
- Announcing a question plan
- Long preamble before the first question
- Skipping divergence points to finish faster
- Re-asking settled points
- Violating scope guards defined by the skill
- Human-like small talk ("Great question!", "Love that idea!")

## Authoring skills that use this concept

1. Instruct the agent to **read this file first** on invoke.
2. Fill in the **extension contract**.
3. Link: `[CONCEPT_ALIGNMENT](../concepts/CONCEPT_ALIGNMENT.md)`.
