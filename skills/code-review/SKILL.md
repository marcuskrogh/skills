  Two-axis GitHub PR review (Standards + Spec) tied to a Jira ticket in In Review
  on the main pipeline. Posts findings on the PR and Jira; hands off to implement
  (fix-forward) or ship. Use when reviewing a PR for a pipeline ticket.
---

Two-axis review posted **on the GitHub pull request** and summarized on the **Jira ticket** — not as repo files or long chat transcripts.

- **Standards** — does the code conform to this repo's documented coding standards?
- **Spec** — does the code faithfully implement the Jira ticket and linked specification?

Both axes run as **parallel sub-agents**, then this skill publishes on the PR and updates Jira.

**On invoke:** read [../workflow/reference.md](../workflow/reference.md) and [../jira/reference.md](../jira/reference.md).

Requires `gh` CLI (authenticated) and Jira API credentials. If either is missing, stop and tell the user.

## Process

### 0. Resolve the Jira ticket

A code review is always tied to one Jira issue in **In Review** (or the project's equivalent).

1. User provides ticket key or URL (e.g. `/code-review SW-200`, or link in message).
2. If missing, ask: "Which Jira ticket is in review?"
3. Fetch the ticket per [../jira/reference.md](../jira/reference.md).
4. Confirm status is **In Review** (or equivalent). If not, stop and tell the user to transition the ticket first.
5. Capture: key, URL, summary, description, sub-tasks, links, attachments (`PLAN.md`, `MODEL.md` hints).

The Jira ticket is the **primary spec source** for the Spec axis (before GitHub issues or repo files).

### 1. Resolve the pull request

Every review happens on a **draft or open** GitHub PR. Resolve it in this order:

1. **PR linked from Jira** — ticket description, comments, or remote links field.
2. **PR the user named** — number, URL, or branch.
3. **PR for the current branch** — `gh pr view --json number,url,state,isDraft,baseRefName,headRefOid,title,body`.
4. **Create a draft PR** — if the branch has commits pushed but no PR yet:
   ```bash
   gh pr create --draft --title "<branch or user title>" --body "WIP — automated review in progress"
   ```

If the branch has no remote or unpushed commits, push first (`git push -u origin HEAD`) then create the draft PR. If push fails, stop and report why.

Confirm the PR is `OPEN` or `DRAFT` and the diff is non-empty (`gh pr diff <number> --name-only`). An empty diff fails here — not inside sub-agents.

Capture for sub-agents:

- PR number and URL
- Base branch (`baseRefName`) and head SHA (`headRefOid`)
- `gh pr diff <number>` output (or `git diff origin/<base>...HEAD` if `gh pr diff` is too large — prefer the PR diff)
- `gh pr view <number> --json commits --jq '.commits[].messageHeadline'`

### 2. Identify the spec source

Look for the originating spec, in this order:

1. **Jira ticket** from step 0 (description, sub-tasks, attachments).
2. **PR description** and linked GitHub issues (`gh issue view`).
3. Issue references in commit messages on the PR branch.
4. Spec files under `docs/`, `specs/`, or repo root (`PLAN.md`, `MODEL.md`, `DOCUMENTATION.md`).
5. Path the user passed as an argument.

If nothing is found beyond the Jira summary, use the ticket body as spec. If the ticket is empty, ask the user once for the spec source.

If `docs/agents/jira.md` exists in the repo, prefer it for Jira workflow details.

### 3. Identify the standards sources

Anything in the repo that documents how code should be written, such as `CODING_STANDARDS.md` or `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

On top of whatever the repo documents, the Standards axis always carries the **smell baseline** below — a fixed set of Fowler code smells (_Refactoring_, ch.3) that applies even when a repo documents nothing. Two rules bind it:

- **The repo overrides.** A documented repo standard always wins; where it endorses something the baseline would flag, suppress the smell.
- **Always a judgement call.** Each smell is a labelled heuristic ("possible Feature Envy"), never a hard violation — and, like any standard here, skip anything tooling already enforces.

Each smell reads *what it is* → *how to fix*; match it against the diff:

- **Mysterious Name** — a function, variable, or type whose name doesn't reveal what it does or holds. → rename it; if no honest name comes, the design's murky.
- **Duplicated Code** — the same logic shape appears in more than one hunk or file in the change. → extract the shared shape, call it from both.
- **Feature Envy** — a method that reaches into another object's data more than its own. → move the method onto the data it envies.
- **Data Clumps** — the same few fields or params keep travelling together (a type wanting to be born). → bundle them into one type, pass that.
- **Primitive Obsession** — a primitive or string standing in for a domain concept that deserves its own type. → give the concept its own small type.
- **Repeated Switches** — the same `switch`/`if`-cascade on the same type recurs across the change. → replace with polymorphism, or one map both sites share.
- **Shotgun Surgery** — one logical change forces scattered edits across many files in the diff. → gather what changes together into one module.
- **Divergent Change** — one file or module is edited for several unrelated reasons. → split so each module changes for one reason.
- **Speculative Generality** — abstraction, parameters, or hooks added for needs the spec doesn't have. → delete it; inline back until a real need shows.
- **Message Chains** — long `a.b().c().d()` navigation the caller shouldn't depend on. → hide the walk behind one method on the first object.
- **Middle Man** — a class or function that mostly just delegates onward. → cut it, call the real target direct.
- **Refused Bequest** — a subclass or implementer that ignores or overrides most of what it inherits. → drop the inheritance, use composition.

### 4. Spawn both sub-agents in parallel

Send a single message with two `Task` tool calls. Use `subagent_type: "generalPurpose"` for both.

Ask each sub-agent to return **structured findings only** — no summary prose, no files written. Every finding is one block:

```text
axis: Standards | Spec
kind: inline | general
path: <repo-relative path>   # required for inline
line: <line number>           # required for inline — RIGHT side of the PR diff
body: <comment markdown, prefixed with **Standards** or **Spec**>
```

**Standards sub-agent prompt** — include:

- PR number, diff, and commit list from step 1.
- Standards-source files from step 3, **plus the smell baseline pasted in full**.
- Brief: "Return findings as structured blocks (format above). Per file/hunk: (a) documented-standard violations — cite file + rule; (b) baseline smells — name the smell. `kind: inline` when you can point at a specific changed line; otherwise `kind: general`. Documented breaches can be hard; smells are always judgement calls; repo standards override the baseline. Skip tooling-enforced rules. Max 12 findings, under 400 words total."

**Spec sub-agent prompt** — include:

- PR number, diff, and commit list from step 1.
- Jira ticket contents from step 0 and spec files from step 2.
- Brief: "Return findings as structured blocks (format above). The Jira ticket is the authoritative spec. Cover: (a) missing/partial requirements; (b) scope creep; (c) wrong implementations. Quote the ticket or spec line in each `body`. `kind: inline` when tied to a specific changed line; otherwise `kind: general`. Max 12 findings, under 400 words total."

If the spec is missing, skip the Spec sub-agent.

### 5. Publish on the PR

Post everything on GitHub. **Do not** write review output to the repo, `.scratch/`, or long chat transcripts.

#### 5a. Build the review

1. Merge findings from both sub-agents. Keep axes separate — do not rerank across axes.
2. **Inline comments** — one per `kind: inline` finding (`path`, `line`, `body`). Line numbers must be on the **new-file (RIGHT) side** of the PR diff at `headRefOid`.
3. **Review body** — markdown with exactly these sections:

```markdown
## Standards
<general Standards findings, or "No general Standards findings.">
<count> Standards finding(s); worst: <one line or "none">

## Spec
<general Spec findings, or "No spec available." / "No general Spec findings.">
<count> Spec finding(s); worst: <one line or "none">
```

4. Choose review event:
   - `COMMENT` — default; review is feedback only.
   - `REQUEST_CHANGES` — only if a **hard** documented-standard violation or clearly missing spec requirement should block merge.
   - `APPROVE` — only if both axes have zero findings (unusual for this skill).

#### 5b. Submit via gh

Submit **one** pull request review with inline comments and the summary body:

```bash
OWNER_REPO=$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner)
HEAD_SHA=$(gh pr view <number> --json headRefOid -q .headRefOid)

gh api "repos/${OWNER_REPO}/pulls/<number>/reviews" \
  --method POST \
  --input - <<'EOF'
{
  "commit_id": "<HEAD_SHA>",
  "event": "COMMENT",
  "body": "<review body markdown>",
  "comments": [
    { "path": "src/example.ts", "line": 42, "body": "**Standards**: ..." }
  ]
}
EOF
```

Build the JSON inline (heredoc or `jq -n`) in the shell — do not commit it to the repo. If a line number cannot be resolved, downgrade that finding to `general` in the review body instead of dropping it.

If the API rejects an inline comment (stale line, unchanged line), post that finding as a **PR conversation comment** instead:

```bash
gh pr comment <number> --body "**Standards** (could not anchor inline): ..."
```

#### 5c. Post on Jira

After the GitHub review is submitted, comment on the Jira ticket per [../jira/reference.md](../jira/reference.md):

```markdown
## Code review posted
PR: <url>
Review event: COMMENT | REQUEST_CHANGES | APPROVE
Standards: <N> finding(s) — worst: …
Spec: <M> finding(s) — worst: …

[Link to PR review or copy general findings summary]

## Next
<handoff line — see Handoff below>
```

The ticket stays **In Review**. Do **not** transition to **Done** — that is [ship](../ship/SKILL.md).

#### 5d. Tell the user

Reply in chat with **only**:

- Jira ticket URL
- PR URL
- One line: review posted — `<N>` Standards / `<M>` Spec findings; event `<COMMENT|REQUEST_CHANGES|APPROVE>`
- **Next** handoff line

Do not paste the full review into chat.

## Handoff

| Outcome | Next |
|---------|------|
| `REQUEST_CHANGES`, or any finding that should block merge | `/implement <KEY>` — Address review findings (fix-forward) |
| `COMMENT` / `APPROVE` with no blocking findings | `/ship <KEY>` — Merge and mark Done |

```markdown
## Next
`/implement <KEY>` — Address review findings (fix-forward)
```

or

```markdown
## Next
`/ship <KEY>` — Merge PR and close the Task
```

## Why two axes

A change can pass one axis and fail the other:

- Code that follows every standard but implements the wrong thing → **Standards pass, Spec fail.**
- Code that does exactly what the issue asked but breaks the project's conventions → **Spec pass, Standards fail.**

Reporting them separately on the PR stops one axis from masking the other.
